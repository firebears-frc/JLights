Arduino Light Code

  This is code for the lights of the Firebears' Vacuum Robot Of 2014(¿c).  This is the arduino code.  The arduino
  communicates with the CRio over I2C.  When certain events on the robot happen, like the vacuum turning on, the robot
  driving, the suction taking hold etc. then the lights change their animation.  The CRIo is the master, and the Arduino is
  the slave.  The lights are for the drivers to have a better visual view of what's going on.
